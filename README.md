Unity 2021.3.11f1

This is a Bubble shooter game where you need to shoot balls of different colors. When hitting balls of the same color, this group of balls bursts if there are more than 3 of them.
The game has two game modes, each with 1 level. The classic game - the balls are pre-arranged, the gun generates balls in a given sequence of colors. Random game - the level is filled with variks with a random sequence of colors, the gun also generates random colors.
When the balloons pop, each makes a random sound and creates a particle system of small balloons of the same color.
Provided the same volume control of music and sounds.
